Created a page of Gifs.


The theme of the gif page is "influential women" throughout history. This topic can cover fictional and non-fictional women.

I created an array of 25 influential women.
I limited the amount of gifs to 10.

Gifs animation section:
When the user clicks on the gif image, the gif animate.
To stop the animation the user clicks on the gif again.

Users can add additional influential women to the gif page. 
Just type the name of the gif you would like to add, in the input box field and click submit.
After you submit, you will see a new button created for your new gif. 
Click on the new button to populate the gif.

There is minimal CSS and Bootstrap used in this assignment.
