Created a page of Gifs.

The themed of the gif page is influential women throughout history. This topic can cover fictional and non-fictional women.
I created an array of 25 influential women.
I limited the amount of gifs to 10.

Gifs animation section:
When the user clicks on the gifs, the gifs animate.
To stop the animation the user clicks on the gif again.

Users can alse add additional influential women to the gif page. 
Just type the womans name in the input box field and click submit.
After you submit, you will see a new button created for your new gif. 
Click on the gif to populate the gifs.

There is minimal CSS and Bootstrap used in this assignment.
There is only one image in this assignment and it used used in the jumbotron as a background image.
